      My name is Liam Craver; I am a developer and a designer from New Orleans, Louisiana.
      My passion is technology; I'm always eager to learn about the latest gadgets or the
      new features that are in the latest patches of my favorite software.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body-1">
      I am an alumnus of <a href="http://www.nocca.com/" class="block">New Orleans Center for Creative Arts</a> and <a href="http://www.edline.net/pages/bfhsla" class="block">Benjamin Franklin HighSchool</a>;
      currently I am pursuing a computer science degree at the <a href="http://www.louisiana.edu/" class="block">University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body-1">
      I work freelance when I can during the schoolyear, but especially during the summer;
      if you want, check out my <a href="http://limestudios.net/" class="block">work page</a>. I'm open to working on projects of all sorts!

      Most of the time, I am a pretty ordinary person. I say things on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/studioslime" class="block">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LiamCraver" class="block">Google+</a>.
      My code ends up on <a href="http://www.github.com/lcraver" class="block">GitHub</a> most of the time.
