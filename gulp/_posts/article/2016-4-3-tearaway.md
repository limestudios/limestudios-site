##Introduction
Tearaway Unfolded originally had it's debut on the PS Vita with simply "Tearaway". On it's initial release it was praised for it's unique and fun gameplay. With the PS4 "reimagining" I think it retains everything that made the original an amazing experience while adding creative and interesting new ways of interacting with the player. From this point on I'm going to exclusively talk about the PS4 version.

##Grading Categories

###Gameplay
The gameplay in Tearaway Unfolded is a weird mix of standard 3D platformer and arts and crafts game. A one of the best uses of motion controls I've ever seen.

###Graphical Aesthetic
The rest of the screenshots should speak for themselves. This is a beautifully designed game. Everything is clearly accounted for including the actual architecture of the island itself. There is this disconnect that something so pretty couldn't exist yet it all is so perfectly crafted it feels like just maybe it could exist.

  </a>
{% endfor %}

###Sound Aesthetic
Every action you make in the game is almost always accompanied by a very satisfying sound. It was clear that sound was a priority for this project. Which without going into more detail is a very good thing.

<h3 id="verdict">[9.0] Verdict : <span class="block lime" text="Lime Certified"></span><a href="/article/rating-system"><sup>(?)</sup></a></h3>
You will be cursing Blow one minute and praising his genius the next. This is a game that knows how to push the player but never unfairly. If you're looking for a nice challenge and a game with mystery and no hand holding, Johnathon Blow along with the rest of Thekla have got you covered. Grab your pen and paper!
