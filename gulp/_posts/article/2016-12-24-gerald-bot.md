##About
Gerald Bot is a chat bot made specifically for livecoding.tv / liveEDU.tv under the ISC license. Gerald comes in two flavors the older <a class="line-s" href="https://github.com/lcraver/gerald_bot">js injected app</a> and the newer <a class="line-s" href="https://github.com/lcraver/gerald_bot_v2">Node.js based app</a>. Gerald is supposed to provide a nice starting point for anyone looking to build their own bot or to be used as an out of box solution. Gerald came to be after I realized I needed help managing my chat and there were no good solutions that did what I needed. I hope you like Gerald as much as I do.
