<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Project Arrhythmia came to be after I found myself frustrated with the lack of any "true" audio bound games. I have always been interested in games like soundodger+, 140 and OSU! where music is a core part of the gameplay however I've also always found the gameplay didn't react to the music as tightly as I wanted it to. So I set out to make a game where every sound from a chiptune beep to a guitar rift could be perfectly represented within the game.</p>
