##About
Untitled RPG is a game made by Liam Craver (Me) and Sabrina Reichel. It's a small prototype of what could end up being a full game. It's based off an RPG engine I've been working on live during my <a class="line-s" href="https://www.livecoding.tv/lcraver/">coding streams</a>.

##Future Plans
I plan to see if I want to further develop this RPG after I finish development on Project Arrhythmia. If I don't I will most likely be releasing the entire code base for free.
