<p>My name is Liam Craver; I am a developer and a designer from New Orleans, Louisiana. My passion is technology; I'm always eager to learn about the latest gadgets or the new features that are in the latest patches of my favorite software.</p>
<p>I am an alumnus of <a class="line-s" href="http://www.nocca.com/">New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts</a> and <a class="line-s" href="http://www.edline.net/pages/bfhsla">Benjamin Franklin Highschool</a>; currently I am pursuing a computer science degree at the <a class="line-s" href="http://www.louisiana.edu/">University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>.</p>
<p>I work freelance when I can during the school year, but especially during the summer; if you want, check out my <a class="line-s" href="http://limestudios.net/portfolio/">portfolio page</a> for examples of my work. I'm open to working on projects of all sorts!</p>
<p>Most of the time, I am a pretty ordinary person. I say things on <a class="line-s twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/liamcraver">Twitter</a> and <a class="line-s tumblr" href="http://lcraver.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. My code ends up on <a class="line-s github" href="http://github.com/lcraver">GitHub</a> most of the time.</p>
<p>The purpose of this website is to serve as an online repository for all my independent work and work done under Lime Studios. The code style guide document, the processes used to build it, and the source can be found on <a class="line-s github" href="http://github.com/limestudios/limestudios-site">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or feedback, you may want to email me at <a class="line-s limestudios" href="mailto:liam@limestudios.net?subject=LimeStudios Site">liam@limestudios.net</a> â€”which you should definitely do since I love to talk.</p>
