    description: 'I love to talk and I thrive on conversation. I like to debate, to collaborate, to combine people’s ideas with mine. All of this I do through conversation with others. Sometimes these conversations happen on Twitter, sometimes they happen over the phone, sometimes with a text, but for me, the best conversations are held in person.> A single conversation across the table with a wise person is worth a month’s study of books.> <cite>Chinese Proverb</cite>However, when I am going out with my friends, we are always on our phones. I never get to hold deep conversations, conversations that matter, with my friends anymore. We are simply too involved with our phones. There is always a group message to reply to and someone to send a Snapchat.By the end of 2013, there will be more mobile devices than people on the planet. Information is everywhere: photos, video, sound, and general data and it will only continue to grow. Half a billion tablets will ship by 2014. Screens are everywhere.Over the past month, I have begun to notice this more and now try to avoid using my phone for unnecessary communication. I have uninstalled Facebook & Twitter and changed the settings on my phone to only check my email once every hour. I have done tons to disconnect myself and it helps make me way more aware of what is really happening.## Still not seeing improvements > Conversation is the music of the mind, an intellectual orchestra, where all the instruments should bear a part, but where none should play together. > <cite>Charles Caleb Colton</cite>An intellectual orchestra turned to a cacophony by distractions.Now that I avoid using my phone when I am with my friends, I notice how distracted we all are. Many times I have gone with my friends to eat and they spend the majority of the time doing _something_ on their phone: usually texting or sending a picture of themselves in the restaurant (…or of their food, #yum) to twenty something friends on Snapchat.Glad to know I, the one friend who is physically here with you, trying to have a conversation in person, matter. One of the reasons I like to go out to eat is not only the food, but to have those conversations that matter, the ones I thrive on, with people I like. I want to get to know you. I want to know how your week went. I want to know how your family has been. And, I am sure you have some questions for me too.Instead you spend half the time interacting in conversation with me. The rest of the time you spend interacting with friends who are not even here with you.What I especially do not like is when you never set your phone back down and I just sit there talking while you say things like uh huh.What an amazing conversation.Actually, I would be better off if I pushed a table against the wall, pulled up a chair, faced the wall and talked to it. At least the wall doesn’t have the blue glow of a phone on its face.Sometimes I will try to have a conversation with someone while dining, and it starts out well. Then they get a text, they open up their phone and respond to the text. That’s okay, I understand if you have to send a quick message to someone. As long as you can continue the conversation with me where we left off, I have no problem with it.## The PetitionPeople are distracted in face-to-face conversations these days. We cannot put their phone away and focus on each other. I might be selfish in requesting your undivided attention, but I know this does not only frustrate me, but others too.My petition to the people of the world is get off your phones and give those around you in the present the attention they deserve. They are here with you; they obviously want to be with you because you matter to them. Let’s be real friends and talk to them.You will be surprised what you can tell some one when you don’t have a 140 character limit. Until then, I will try texting my friends across the table when we go out for dinner.That should work perfectly.'
